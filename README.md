**Shelter** is the culmination of a dedicated effort during my final year of the BCA program.
<br><br>
This Python Flask-based web platform addresses the pressing issue of child abuse reporting.
<br><br>
It offers a **secure and confidential** means for users to report child abuse cases, ensuring the safety and well-being of children.
<br><br>
**Front End:**
The front-end of the project was developed using HTML and CSS to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
<br><br>
**Back End:**
The back-end, powered by Python Flask, ensures seamless functionality and secure data processing.
<br><br>
**Operating System:**
The Shelter project is optimized for the **Windows** operating system, providing a familiar and accessible environment for users.
<br><br>
**Software Requirements:**
The back-end functionality is built on the Python Flask framework, ensuring a robust and scalable solution for handling child abuse reporting. Users need to have Python Flask installed to seamlessly interact with the platform.
<br><br>
**Hardware Requirements:**
- **Processor:** Shelter requires an Intel Core i3 processor or above, providing sufficient computational power for smooth operation.
- **RAM:** A minimum of 4GB RAM is recommended to handle concurrent user interactions and data processing efficiently.
- **Storage:** The project assumes a storage capacity of at least 250GB, accommodating data storage and potential future expansions.
<br><br>
**Module Description:**
- **Admin Module**
- **Teacher Module**
- **Parent Module**
